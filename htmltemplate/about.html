								<h3>About</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/about/received_1020339534739320.jpeg" alt="" style="float: left"/></span>
								<p>Hello! I'm Hwei-Shin Harriman (pronounced "way-sheen").
								</p>

                                <p>I am a software engineer and illustrator with a passion for working at the
									intersection of technology and design. I love making beautiful things, whether that be through code, illustration, or visual design.
								</p>
								<p>	I was born and raised in Novato, CA. I am currently a junior at Olin College of Engineering, in Boston, MA, where I major in
									Software Engineering. Ever since I was little, my parents encouraged have encouraged me to pursue anything that
								sparked my interest.</p>

								<h4>What I Care About</h4>
								<p>At Olin, there is a strong emphasis on being aware of the impact that engineering can have on society. We learn, within our first semester, that 
									engineers, who have the power to create both amazing and terrible things, should be expected to understand the social, ethical, and environmental impacts 
									that their decisions will bring about. It is not enough to simply
									create, without consideration of the consequences.<br />
									No matter the field, designers and engineers are working together to shape our future, day-in and day-out. As an individual who is looking to join this effort, I believe in supporting
									causes that will build a better world, and taking on the responsibility that all engineers and designers should take on: making decisions motivated by 
									their ability to do good, not by their convenience or potential for monetary gain.
								</p>

								<h4>Software</h4>
								<p> I have experience working as a full-stack engineer in an industry environment, and I also enjoy machine learning, learning about image processing, and helping others
									learn to code. Check out the software engineering section of my portfolio to see more of what I have been working on.

								Skills at a glance:
								<ul>
									<li>TypeScript/React</li>
									<li>Python</li>
									<li>C/C++</li>

								</ul>
								<h4>Illustration and Design</h4>
								<p>In addition to coding, I also study visual design, and I am a self-taught illustrator. I have been working as a freelance
									illustrator since I graduated high school, and I've started to formalize my training through various design projects and
									courses at Olin. Check out the illustration and design sections of my portfolio for more information about the projects
									I have worked on.

									<h5>Other Interests</h5>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/about/lilacfairy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										I love ballet. I have been dancing since I was 4, training to become a professional since I was 10, and 
										I even danced with the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam for a year before starting
										college. These days, even though I have switched career paths, I still find time to take classes, teach, 
										and perform with the Harvard Ballet Company.</p>
									<p>Some of my other interests include playing ultimate frisbee, making and enjoying good coffee, playing Competitive
										Overwatch, accumulating new restaurant recommendations.
