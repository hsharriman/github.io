        <p style="color: white;">Established in 2000, the Youth America Grand Prix is the world's largest annual ballet competition.
                Every year, the finals are held in New York City, bringing aspiring ballerinas from all over the world to compete for scholarships,
                exposure, and contracts with professional ballet companies. This visualization explores where the competition winners in the past
                twenty years were trained.
