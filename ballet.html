                    Collected and visualized data of my years as a ballerina using Illustrator and matplotlib.

                    This project was created for "Tell the Story of What You Make", a design course offered at Olin College of Engineering. The prompt was to create a poster based on the Feltron reports, using our own personal dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone who pursued professional ballet through childhood and adolescence, I felt that this project would be a good way to reflect on my time and experiences. The results are synthesized in the poster to the left.
