                    Created a program which accepts a search term as an input, and scrapes Google, Wikipedia, and Medium
                    to dynamically output topics that are related to the original search term. The scraped articles were
                    used to train a machine learning model designed for topic modeling: LDA. This project was created as a final
                    project for the FA'19 offering of Machine Learning at Olin College of Engineering.

                    Some words from the project <a class="hyperlink" href="https://github.com/epan547/Topic-Modeling-Buddy">Github:</a>

                    In our experience, sometimes the hardest part of starting a project in a new space is simply knowing where to start. Googling the general term returns some results, but depending on the field and level of technical detail it can be difficult to parse the information. Often times, it takes reading several articles before the core concepts behind a topic become clear.

                    The goal of this project was to create a tool that would make it easy for interested individuals to familiarize themselves with a new concept. Using topic modeling, we can take a concept word and present a list of keywords and resources that could help a user gain a broader understanding of the topic they originally searched. For example, if the keyword "machine learning" is entered, some possible results would be "weight, network, layer, backpropagation, etc.", accompanied by "introductory" resources like Wikipedia and various Medium post tutorials.
