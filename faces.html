                            Implemented two facial recognition algorithms using MATLAB to correctly identify when 2 portraits
                            were of the same person. The implementations were tested on a dataset of faces made up from our classmates.
                            This project was completed as part of the SP'18 offering of Quantitative Engineering Analysis at Olin College of
                            Engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These facial recognition algorithms make use of the observation that faces are similar enough to each
                            other in appearance (most faces have 2 eyes, a nose, and a mouth). Because of this, if 2 pictures of a person
                            are taken at the same angle, with the same lighting and closeness, then it can be assumed that only
                            some parts of the image are of importance. By using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues and some linear algebra
                            concepts, we can effectively reduce the number of dimensions needed to represent the face.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The primary difference between the two algorithms is how they determine a "match". In Eigenfaces, the two images with the
                            smallest difference are considered a match. In Bayesian, a match is determined by the likelihood that two pictures are of
                            the same person.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The two plots show the performance of each algorithm alongside the number of
                            eigenvectors used to represent the low-dimensional "face space". Figure 3 is for Eigenfaces,
                            and Figure 4 is for Bayesian Facial Recognition.
