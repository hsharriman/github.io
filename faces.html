                    Implemented two facial recognition algorithms using Matlab to correctly identify when 2 portraits
                    were of the same person. The implementations were tested on a dataset of faces made up from our classmates.
                    This project was completed as part of the SP'18 offering of Quantitative Engineering Analysis at Olin College of
                    Engineering.

                    These facial recognition algorithms make use of the observation that faces are similar enough to each
                    other in appearance (most faces have 2 eyes, a nose, and a mouth). Because of this, if 2 pictures of a person
                    are taken at the same angle, with the same lighting and closeness, then it can be reasonably assumed that only
                    some parts of the image are of importance. By using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues and some linear algebra
                    concepts, we are able to effectively reduce the number of dimensions needed to represent the face.

                    The primary difference between the two algorithms is how they determine a "match". In Eigenfaces, the two images with the
                    smallest difference are considered a match. In Bayesian, a match is determined by the likelihood that two pictures are of
                    the same person.
