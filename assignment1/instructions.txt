Instructions:
1. Create a default html and css file.
3. Disable scrolling across the entire html document.
4. Google starry background wallpaper and save the first image result.
5. Use the saved image to make the background of your webpage.
6. Create a black tint for the background by creating an element that
is the same size as the webpage window and setting its color to an 80%
opaque black. Make sure that its size is responsive.
7. Create an animation that changes the background color from 
0% opacity to white and 80% opacity, then back to 0% opacity.
8. Create a class for an element that starts with no background color,
is about the size of a medium-sized star (in comparison to the background
image), circular, and has a little blur around the edges. Set its
attributes so that you can position it using absolute values (as
opposed to relative). Make sure that the size of the element is responsive.
9. Set the animation of the class to use the animation that you created.
The desired effect should slowly fade in and out infinitely.
10. Add a lot of these elements to your document. For each element,
give it a different position on the document, and vary the animation
start time between elements (hint: you may consider googling how to add elements
to your html document in random positions using javascript if you
feel comfortable with it).
