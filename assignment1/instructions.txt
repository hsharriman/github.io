Instructions:
1. Create a default html and css file.
3. Disable scrolling across the entire html document.
4. Google starry background wallpaper and save the first image result.
5. Use the saved image to make the background of your webpage.
6. Create a black tint for the background by creating an element that
is the same size as the webpage window and setting its color to an 80%
opaque black.
7. Create a class for an element that starts with no background color,
is about the size of a medium-sized star (in comparison to the background
image), circular, and has a little blur around the edges. Set its
attributes so that you can position it using absolute values (as
opposed to relative).
