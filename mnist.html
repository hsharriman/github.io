                    Programmed two separate neural networks using only Python and Numpy to recognize handwritten digits as part of my final
                    project for the FA'18 offering of Quantitative Engineering Analysis at Olin College of Engineering.

                    This project is meant to be a deep exploration into the math behind neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks. 
                    As such, there is no use of high-level packages such as Pytorch or Tensorflow, since the goal was to understand the math that 
                    drives these powerful tools. My implementation was able to achieve 89% accuracy on the test set.

                    In addition to implementing a feedforward and convolutional network, I also implemented dataset pre-processing, 
                    batch and epoch capabilities, incremental testing, as well as saving and loading checkpoints.
