                            Programmed a robotic vacuum cleaner equipped with a LIDAR sensor to navigate an obstacle course using
                            RANSAC to detect obstacles (boxes) and gradient descent to determine the shortest path to the target (a bucket). This project
                            was completed as part of the FA'18 offering of Quantitative Engineering Analysis at Olin College of Engineering.

                        <div class="body">
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    To begin, the robot scanned its surroundings via LIDAR&mdash;then iteratively performed RANSAC,
                                    an algorithm that determines curves of best fit without being affected by outliers&mdash;to locate
                                    all likely "obstacles". RANSAC is also used at this step to search for the target. If an arc is detected, 
                                    this curve is determined to be the target.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A steep paraboloid which fills the entire obstacle course is placed with its center overlapping the calculated
                                    center of the target. This allows the robot to perform gradient descent to reach the target.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Additionally, wherever an obstacle has been detected, an extreme local maximum is placed to prevent the
                                    robot from driving into obstacles.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Finally, the gradient vectors for each point in the plane are calculated, which in turn iteratively guides robot
                                    to its target.
                                </li>

                            by the robot from a top-down view. The "height" of the terrain is shown as the red/blue rings.
                            The orange vectors visualize the gradient at each of those points
