                    Designed an alternative branding concept for Neri Oxman's exhibit at the MoMA for the SP'20 offering of Advanced Typography at Parsons School of Design.
                    The final product involved a poster and wall graphic.

                    "From tree bark and crustacean shells to silkworm webs and human breath, nature shapes Neri Oxman’s innovative design and production processes. As a designer, architect, and founding director 
                    of The Mediated Matter Group at the MIT Media Lab, Oxman has developed not only new ways of thinking about materials, objects, buildings, and construction methods, but also new frameworks for 
                    interdisciplinary—and even interspecies—collaborations. Her pioneering approach, which she calls “material ecology,” brings together materials science, digital fabrication technologies, and 
                    organic design, to create new possibilities for the future. While individually these works are beautiful and revolutionary, together they put forward a new philosophy of designing, 
                    making—and even unmaking—the world around us."

                <div class="body">
                    The mix of organic and engineered approaches that are synthesized in Oxman's work is captured by the contrast between structured, sans-serif typeface
                    and distorted, organic shapes.
