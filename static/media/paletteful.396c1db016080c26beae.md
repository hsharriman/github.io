Created a website that allows users to generate color palettes based on their favorite images. The user is able to view the hex and RGB codes of the palettes, and easily copy/paste them. Additionally, the color palettes may be downloaded as .png files to be accessed by or transferred to other programs for reference.

The program uses OpenCV and knowledge of traditional color palettes (dominant/accent, analogous) to determine which colors within an image most "define" the palette.
