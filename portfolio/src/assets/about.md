I am a 2nd year PhD student at the [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Dominik Moritz](https://www.domoritz.de/)
and a member of the [Data Interaction Group](https://dig.cmu.edu/) and [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/). I am a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program Recipient and an ARCS Scholar. My research is centered on defining, creating, and evaluating
interactive diagrams. I am passionate about improving STEM
education, particularly by improving visual communication in
learning materials. I am always looking for interesting ways that
technology and design intersect, and I care about working on
projects that help people.

Outside of research, I am a classically trained ballerina (I've been dancing since I was 4). In my free time, I enjoy making illustrations and graphic designs, drinking lattes, finding new restaurants to try, and playing PC video games.
