I am a 2nd year PhD student in the [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Dominik Moritz](https://www.domoritz.de/) and a member of the [Data Interaction Group](https://dig.cmu.edu/) and [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/) groups. I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program Recipient and an ARCS Scholar.

My research combines aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, software engineering, and STEM education. I am broadly interested in building tools that use visualization to aid with sense-making, whether that be through abstract diagramming or data visualization. I am currently working on building tools to create interactive diagrams in Euclidean geometry and beyond.

I've previously worked at Tableau as a fullstack engineer and completed software engineering internships at Tesla Motors and Tableau.

Outside of research, I enjoy doing ballet, making illustrations, playing video games.
