For my senior capstone, I worked with the non-profit [Air Partners](https://airpartners.org/) and clean air activist organizations in Bostonâ€™s underprivileged neighborhoods of East Boston and Roxbury. For this yearlong project, I converted R scripts into a scheduled data analysis pipeline using Python. The pipeline analyzed the concentrations of dangerous [ultrafine particles (UFPs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafine_particle) near roadways and the Logan International Airport, using raw data pulled from special UFP sensors on an hourly basis. The data was used by an air quality app that notified users of the current risk of exposure to UFPs in their area. The results from these tools have been used to raise awareness and inform policy enactments championing cleaner air in their communities.

An example of a daily report from one of the many sensors around the Boston area is shown below.
