                    This competition "has served as a prestigious design competition with the purpose of discovering and nurturing the next generation of Disney Imagineers from a diverse array of disciplines and skillsets." This year, the competition prompted contestants to "create an iconic at the contestants' own campus or city that serves as an inspiration, honors the past, and is a vision of the future."

                    Our submission focused on the city of Boston, a historic and long-standing city, and home to our college. In the 21st century, rising sea levels due to climate change threaten the coastal city. We picked the harbor along the South Cove district of Boston, which faces an ever-increasing risk of flooding.

                    "Harmonia Park" is a community-centered park located at the South Cove waterfront, which serves to increase climate change awareness, honor Boston's rich history, and protect the city's historical land from rising water levels. The park has areas above and below ground, making it accessible throughout the year. It features cutting-edge, sustainable materials and provides both indoor and outdoor spaces for community events.
