                    Researched, designed, and illustrated a semi-finalist entry to the 29th Annual Walt Disney
                    Imagineering Imaginations Design Competition.

                    This year, the competition prompted contestants to "create an iconic installation at the contestants'
                    own campus or city that serves as an inspiration, honors the past, and is a vision of the future."
                </p>

                    We chose to focus our submission on the city of Boston, a historic and long-standing city, and home
                    to our college. We designed an elevated park located along the South Cove waterfront, an area that
                    faces an ever-increasing risk of flooding.

                    "Harmonia Park" is a community-centered park located at the South Cove waterfront, which serves to
                    increase climate change awareness, honor Boston's rich history, and protect the city's historical
                    land from rising water levels. The park has areas above and below ground, making it accessible
                    throughout the year. It features cutting-edge, sustainable materials and provides both indoor and
                    outdoor spaces for community events.
