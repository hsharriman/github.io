                    Designed a website that generates posters in the style of Swiss Modernism using Javascript and HTML/CSS. This project was created
                    for the SP'20 offerring of Core Studio Interaction at Parsons School of Design.

                    from the project's website:
                </div>
                <div class="body">
                    "Using pure Javascript, the generator pseudo-randomly combines attributes that are commonly found in posters made
                    in the Swiss International Style to create infinite variations of any given poster, all with the press of a button. 
                    The text that fills the poster can be filled in by visitors to the site.
                </div>
                <div class="body">
                    As with all work in the Swiss Style, the posters are created on a strict grid, which sometimes appears rotated with respect to the canvas. 
                    Sometimes, graphic elements are present, which can take on a number of different shapes and colors. Text is always sans-serif and usually
                    black for readability. The Swiss Style emphasizes cleanliness and objectivity, so the titles, subtitles, and body text are clearly distinguished
                    by size. All of these attributes have been coded into the generator, abstracted so that visitors to the site need not get overwhelmed with the details."
